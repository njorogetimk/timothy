          This is Timothy Kinoro Njoroge. An Electrical and Telecommunications
          graduate engineer from Multimedia University of Kenya. I love
          exploring new ideas in the communication sector, and updating myself
          on the new technologies that come up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since completing my degree, I have been exploring the world of python
          web development, using flask. With this knowledge, I have done a few
          self paced projects based on flask. Two of them are listed below and
          many more can be found on my
          <a href="https://github.com/njorogetimk" target="_blank">github</a>
          page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also done a CCNA certification and am currently exploring the
          awsome and somewhat intimidating but fun world of AWS. In the long
          run, I envision my self working in the Dev-ops world.

              <p>
                This is a system developed to record billing information of
                LCMWS clients. It aims to have a central database for all the
                records and a way to access them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project idea was a suggesion of a community member in Limuko
                village (Which is where my parents reside). My aim was to
                implement the various skills learn over time on a real world
                project.
              </p>
              <p>
                My aim was to use docker and host it on AWS, which was a
                success.

              <p>
                This is an API that helps centralize farm records(dairy) for
                ease of access and use. The goal is to ensure all records are
                well managed.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been in the farming business for a while. In the course
                of time, I noticed farmers do not keep records. This project
                idea came from my interaction with a few farmers in the field.
              </p>
              <p>
                My goal at the time was to see how FastAPI works and how to
                document a flask API using Swagger.
